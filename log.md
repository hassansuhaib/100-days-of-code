# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 13, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Used GitHub for the first time ever, worked on my pset4 in CS50.

**Some Thoughts:** I am really excited today for starting this challenge. I have been a student of CS for the past 3 years but haven't done anything proper or learnt anything. Last semester we were taught Java but because of the poor infrastructure of my university and my laziness I didn't learn much. On top of that our teacher just gave ONE assignment IN THE WHOLE SEMESTER. At the end, the blame is on me because I don't really have an excuse in this age of tech where there are so many resources available online.
I always was afraid to login to GitHub and see what it is but today was the day that I said enough is enough and I need to do something about my life. I'm currently reading a book my Mark Manson and it's really inspiring a change in me and I hope that I remain consistent this time around.
In pset4, we're required to applying filters on bmp image file. Those filters are Grayscale(Done), Sepia(Done), Mirror(Can't figure out how to do it yet) and Blur(Pending). I tried swaping the pixels but it didn't work out. I have to think of something else tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 14 ,2020. 

**Today's Progress:** Logic for blurring and mirroring a bitmap image in my Pset4 in CS50.

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~ 2 hours.

**Thoughts:** Working on pset4. Completed the logic for it but I am getting some errors and I have to solve them yet. Due to tight schedule I couldn't complete it today. Tomorrow I hope to fix it and by the end of this weekend I hope to solve the Pset4. I was thinking about starting the FreeCodeCamp because I have a subject: Web Based Application Development and I think this camp will help me a lot in learning at a fast pace. Our teacher told us a little bit about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery today.The real stuff will start from Monday and I am excited about the course but not the teaching style of the teacher because usually the teachers at my uni teach at a very slow pace and I get frustrated at that. That's it for today!

### Day 3: February 15, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first part of Pset4 in CS50 and 50% of Basic HTML at freecodecamp.org.

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~ 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** Had to take some hints from the discord server because I brainstormed but I was making a small mistake which I corrected later on. Started the course on FreeCodeCamp and I am loving it. The way they have made the website, the way the lessons are listed, the interactivity; they all make you wanna do more and more in a single sitting and just keep on learning. I'm excited about this new coding journey that I have started and I am proud of myself for overcoming my incosistency and lack of determination.

### Day 4: February 16, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the chapter of Basic HTML and 50% of CSS

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~1 hour

**Thoughts:** Started off with HTMl and learnt about forms, labels, input, divs, radio input, checkboxes and buttons. Then in CSS, they taught me about color, fonts, inline styling, internal styling, external stylesheets, classes, ids, borders, padding and margin. I learnt these things before but I have forgotten about them so I am trying to fly throught the course for now. 

### Day 5: February 17, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed CSS on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Learning:** ~40 mins

**Thoughts:** CSS is getting harder but I have to keep up with it so I can learn Web Development in its true sense. FreeCodeCamp is teaching things that I have never ever seen before in any course like using ":root", @media and variable. Now I have started the chapter of Applied Visual Design and I hope to learn some real stuff and then apply it later on. Didn't get the time to invest in Pset4 today and will do that tomorrow In Shaa Allah!

### Day 6: February 18, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed 73# of Appied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp

**Time Spent Learning:** ~1 Hour

**Thoughts:** Today I learned some really intriguing stuff. I've now realized how powerful CSS is. You can animate, create a penguin, apply gradients and all kinds of stuff. I hope to make awesome websites using all this code in the future. It will be fun. I'm thinking about learning flutter so that I can make apps in it to participate in the upcoming competition in Lahore where I can compete in either App Development or Web Application Development.

### Day 7: February 19, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the chapter of Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp and started the pset4 part2.

**Time Spent Learning:** ~1 hour

**Thoughts:** I started doing part 2 of Pset4 of CS50 by fighting the excrutiating pain that brain interprets when faced with a challenging task which result in procratination. Then FCC(FreeCodeCamp) taught me about animations today and it was pretty exciting. Learned about animation-duration, @keyframes, animation-fill-mode, animation-name, animation-timing-funtion, and animation-iteration-count. Had a lot fun animation stuff. Tomorrow I'll start the chapter of Applied Accessibility. Tried creating a pull request on GitHub but turns out you can't approve your own pull requests :(

### Day 8: February 20, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed almost half of the Applied Accessibility Chapter.

**Thoughts:** Today was quite a hectic day so I didn't get to do a lot of learning no FreeCodeCamp. Learnt about audio, nav, article, main, alt atribute, header, head and footer tags today. Can't wait to build real projects soon! I did register for a competition SOFTEC '20 in Web Development and hope to do something half decent over there.

### Day 9: February 21, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Applied Accessibilty Chapter.

**Thoughts:** I had free time earlier in the day and I have to travel later in the day, so I thought why not take my daily dose of code. I learned about tableindex, date, time, hiding a table, accesskey, fieldset etc. Hope to apply all these good practices when I am buidling my own designs.

### Day 10: February 22, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Nailed the chapter of Flex-Box on @freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Understood the concept of flex-box. It really makes designing the webpage easier. Learned attributes like flex-direction, justify-content, self-allign, dispaly etc. After the next chapter, our exercise is to make 5 projects i.e complete web designs. I'm very looking forward to it because I can't wait to implement the things that I have learnt. 

### Day 11: February 23, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed almost half of the chapter of CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** Today I learned that the difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid is the flexbox can either deal with row or column at a time while CSS Grid deals with Rows and Columns simultaniously. Today's attributes were display: grid, grid-template-column, grid-template-row, justify-self, allign-self, grid-columns, grid-rows etc.

### Day 12: February 24, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the chapter on CSS Grid on @freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** I tried to do the project but I instantly forgot everything and I am worried about how will I ever be able to learn when I have this weak memory. Although I do admit that I didn't practice enough due to lack of time. I hope that I can recall all stuff and practice. I will make some projects out of FreeCodeCamp to see how much I have learned. May God help me!

### Day 13: February 25, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Designed the Tribute page as my First Responsive Web Design Project @freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** At first I was intimidated and couldn't think of anything but then I started coding and came up with something half decent. I am trying my best to at least become able to make decent pages even using BootStrap but a person should be aware of the basic concepts of something that they are learning. I have become familiar with basic concepts but I keep forgetting the syntax and I am sure that as I keep learning and practicing, I will become an expert. It just takes time, patience and consistency.

### Day 14: February 26, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Just a little bit code of Project "Survey Form" @freecode camp

**Thoughts:** Was very busy today learning CPU Registers for the upcoming quiz and teaching a fellow student. I can't think of anything else to write over here so I am gonna sign off!! Looking forward to a good day tomorrow!

### Day 15: February 27, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Not much just a revision of CSS

**Thoughts:** Today was again a very hectic day and didn't get enough time to use my computer. But I did revise some CSS for a quiz. I'm thinking of starting a course on YouTube alongside @freeCodeCamp just to consolidate the concepts.

### Day 18: March 1, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed project 2 @freecodecamp. Didn't work one the main tag whole heartedly because I was too tired and bored.

### Day 19: March 2, 2020.

**Today's Progres:** Almost completed Project 3: Product Landing Page at @freeCodeCamp. Just a little bit of work is left. The most difficult part is positioning the items but I'm making progress. Actually I'm getting fast at figuring out stuff in #CSS & #HTML. Will complete it tomorrow!

### Day 20: March 3, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Finished Project 3 of Responsive Web Design @freeCodeCamp. Learned a lot doing this one. I'm getting better and fast at figuring out things.

### Day 23: March 6, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Learned conditional statements but also events in JavaScript. Yeah, the sequence doesn't make sense but it happened. I was traveling today so didn't write much code and on top of that, I forgot my laptop charger at uni hostel. That was my day! :(

### Day 24: March 7, 2020. 

**Today's Progress:** Finished 70% of JavaScript at @freeCodeCamp. Revised comparison operators, conditional statements and switch statement. As always enjoyed it. Peace
