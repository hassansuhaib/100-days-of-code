# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 13, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Used GitHub for the first time ever, worked on my pset4 in CS50.

**Some Thoughts:** I am really excited today for starting this challenge. I have been a student of CS for the past 3 years but haven't done anything proper or learnt anything. Last semester we were taught Java but because of the poor infrastructure of my university and my laziness I didn't learn much. On top of that our teacher just gave ONE assignment IN THE WHOLE SEMESTER. At the end, the blame is on me because I don't really have an excuse in this age of tech where there are so many resources available online.
I always was afraid to login to GitHub and see what it is but today was the day that I said enough is enough and I need to do something about my life. I'm currently reading a book my Mark Manson and it's really inspiring a change in me and I hope that I remain consistent this time around.
In pset4, we're required to applying filters on bmp image file. Those filters are Grayscale(Done), Sepia(Done), Mirror(Can't figure out how to do it yet) and Blur(Pending). I tried swaping the pixels but it didn't work out. I have to think of something else tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 14 ,2020. 

**Today's Progress:** Logic for blurring and mirroring a bitmap image in my Pset4 in CS50.

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~ 2 hours.

**Thoughts:** Working on pset4. Completed the logic for it but I am getting some errors and I have to solve them yet. Due to tight schedule I couldn't complete it today. Tomorrow I hope to fix it and by the end of this weekend I hope to solve the Pset4. I was thinking about starting the FreeCodeCamp because I have a subject: Web Based Application Development and I think this camp will help me a lot in learning at a fast pace. Our teacher told us a little bit about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery today.The real stuff will start from Monday and I am excited about the course but not the teaching style of the teacher because usually the teachers at my uni teach at a very slow pace and I get frustrated at that. That's it for today!

### Day 3: February 15, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first part of Pset4 in CS50 and 50% of Basic HTML at freecodecamp.org.

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~ 2.5 hours.

**Thoughts:** Had to take some hints from the discord server because I brainstormed but I was making a small mistake which I corrected later on. Started the course on FreeCodeCamp and I am loving it. The way they have made the website, the way the lessons are listed, the interactivity; they all make you wanna do more and more in a single sitting and just keep on learning. I'm excited about this new coding journey that I have started and I am proud of myself for overcoming my incosistency and lack of determination.

### Day 4: February 16, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the chapter of Basic HTML and 50% of CSS

**Time Spent in Coding:** ~1 hour

**Thoughts:** Started off with HTMl and learnt about forms, labels, input, divs, radio input, checkboxes and buttons. Then in CSS, they taught me about color, fonts, inline styling, internal styling, external stylesheets, classes, ids, borders, padding and margin. I learnt these things before but I have forgotten about them so I am trying to fly throught the course for now. 

### Day 5: February 17, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed CSS on FreeCodeCamp.

**Time Spent Learning:** ~40 mins

**Thoughts:** CSS is getting harder but I have to keep up with it so I can learn Web Development in its true sense. FreeCodeCamp is teaching things that I have never ever seen before in any course like using ":root", @media and variable. Now I have started the chapter of Applied Visual Design and I hope to learn some real stuff and then apply it later on. Didn't get the time to invest in Pset4 today and will do that tomorrow In Shaa Allah!

### Day 6: February 18, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed 73% of Appied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp

**Time Spent Learning:** ~1 hour

**Thoughts:** Today I learned some really intriguing stuff. I've now realized how powerful CSS is. You can animate, create a penguin, apply gradients and all kinds of stuff. I hope to make awesome websites using all this code in the future. It will be fun. I'm thinking about learning flutter so that I can make apps in it to participate in the upcoming competition in Lahore where I can compete in either App Development or Web Application Development.

### Day 7: February 19, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Completed the chapter of Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp and started the pset4 part2.

**Time Spent Learning:** ~1 hour

**Thoughts:** I started doing part 2 of Pset4 of CS50 by fighting the excrutiating pain that brain interprets when faced with a challenging task which result in procratination. Then FCC(FreeCodeCamp) taught me about animations today and it was pretty exciting. Learned about animation-duration, @keyframes, animation-fill-mode, animation-name, animation-timing-funtion, and animation-iteration-count. Had a lot fun animation stuff. Tomorrow I'll start the chapter of Applied Accessibility.
