# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 13, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** Used GitHub for the first time ever, worked on my pset4 in CS50.

**Some Thoughts:** I am really excited today for starting this challenge. I have been a student of CS for the past 3 years but haven't done anything proper or learnt anything. Last semester we were taught Java but because of the poor infrastructure of my university and my laziness I didn't learn much. On top of that our teacher just gave ONE assignment IN THE WHOLE SEMESTER. At the end, the blame is on me because I don't really have an excuse in this age of tech where there are so many resources available online.
I always was afraid to login to GitHub and see what it is but today was the day that I said enough is enough and I need to do something about my life. I'm currently reading a book my Mark Manson and it's really inspiring a change in me and I hope that I remain consistent this time around.
In pset4, we're required to applying filters on bmp image file. Those filters are Grayscale(Done), Sepia(Done), Mirror(Can't figure out how to do it yet) and Blur(Pending). I tried swaping the pixels but it didn't work out. I have to think of something else tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 14 ,2020. 

**Today's Progress:** Logic for blurring and mirroring a bitmap image in my Pset4 in CS50.
**Time Spent in Coding:** ~ 2 hours.
**Thoughts:** Working on pset4. Completed the logic for it but I am getting some errors and I have to solve them yet. Due to tight schedule I couldn't complete it today. Tomorrow I hope to fix it and by the end of this weekend I hope to solve the Pset4. I was thinking about starting the FreeCodeCamp because I have a subject: Web Based Application Development and I think this camp will help me a lot in learning at a fast pace. Our teacher told us a little bit about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery today.The real stuff will start from Monday and I am excited about the course but not the teaching style of the teacher because usually the teachers at my uni teach at a very slow pace and I get frustrated at that. That's it for today!
